  h1 Conditionals

  - var user = {description: 'foo bar baz'}
  - var authorised = false
  #user
    if user.description
      h2.green Description
      p.description= user.description
    else if authorised
      h2.blue Description
      p.description.
        User has no description,
        why not add one...
    else
      h2.red Description
      p.description User has no description

  p Pug also provides the conditional unless, which works like a negated if. The following are equivalent:

  unless user.isAnonymous
    p You're logged in as #{user.name}
